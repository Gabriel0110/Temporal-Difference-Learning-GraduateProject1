# Temporal-Difference-Learning-GraduateProject1
Project from my Reinforcement Learning graduate program from Spring 2020, including code and my paper on it.

The goal was to read Richard Sutton's famous RL paper from 1988 and replicate his experiment results as best as possible via experimenting with model parameters to understand how the parameters affect the performance and outcome of training.  The code opens three graphs of the attempted figure replications after training.

Please refer to my paper in this repository to see results of experimentation and a full write-up of the project.
