# Temporal-Difference-Learning-GraduateProject1
Project from my Reinforcement Learning graduate program from 2019, including code and my paper on it.

The goal was to read Richard Sutton's famous RL paper from 1988 and replicate his experiment results as best as possible via experimenting with model parameters to understand how the parameters affect the performance and outcome of training.  The code opens three graphs of the attempted figure replications after training.
